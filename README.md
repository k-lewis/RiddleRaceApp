=============

Firstly, download the app files. The app should be opened and built in Android Studio. The app is dependent upon Android API levels 19 and 21, the Facebook to Android API (v2.2), and the Google Maps API (v2). Additionally the Google Play package must be installed via the SDK manager. Once the dependent SDKs and APIs are downloaded the app should run normally. For our development we used Genymotion, an Android emulator application that syncs well with Android Studio.

*Note: For our app the build MUST be in release mode in order for Facebook to work. We generated keys for both the Facebook and Google APIs (two keys in total). If the app doesn't work at all it is most likely due to the lack of a signature. Please contact ztc@bu.edu if the signature is necessary for building.
